# Helicopter Game

A 3D helicopter game built with Godot Engine. The player controls a helicopter, navigating through obstacles with inertia-based movement. The goal is to reach the target while avoiding collisions.

## Features
- **Realistic flight physics**: Inertia-based movement with acceleration and deceleration.
- **Smooth camera tracking**: The camera follows the helicopter dynamically.
- **Collision and explosions**: When the helicopter crashes, an explosion effect is triggered.
- **Delayed movement start**: Pressing a direction key starts movement after a short delay.
- **Vertical movement**: The helicopter can ascend and descend.

## Controls
- **Arrow keys / WASD** – Move forward, backward, left, and right.
- **Spacebar** – Hover in place.
- **Shift** – Descend.
- **Esc** – Pause the game.
